## introduction

this app is intended as a working example of how to build and run node web servers, running multiple types at the same time so the learner can quickly get up and running any type of web server so desired ... the idea is for the code to be as simple and modular as possible ie can be picked up in simple chunks by anyone learning the craft of building a web server.  It also will progress in difficulty, so a learner can progress in knowledge in a linear fashion from easy to difficult, in graded steps

## installation

```js
yarn add express 
yarn global add nodemon
```

## running

```js
nodemon crud-app.js
```
