# nestjs

## introduction

nestjs is used as an alternative framework to `expressjs` which is very common in nodejs

nestjs has the advantage in that it clearly defines the architecture of the app which enables the app to be split up into small components and used in a microservices architecture

nestjs also supports databases such as 
- postgresql
- mongodb
- mysql

## key features

- modules - blocks of code
- providers - services which can be injected into code
- controllers - handle incoming requests and return response to client
