## introduction

wasm is running compiled code in the browser

we can run using js, go, rust etc

I have started with js as it's simplest ..

## worked example

I was using this as a worked example with already pre-running and working code

## wat to wasm

we can convert wat wasm text files to wasm binary using this website

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Text_format_to_Wasm

but the instructions are exceedingly complex so I opted for this free web solution in the end

https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/

check out wasm-by-example and head to examples/demo to check out assembly3 project which has great custom stuff; very happy with this.

i did try the rust version but did not get to completion
